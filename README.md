The repository contains the source code for a simulation video game. The player is a company commander and the core mechanic is receiving and giving orders. The inspiration is the HBO series Band of Brothers which I was watching while I was sick and started the repo.

* v1 - initial exploratory prototype
* v2 - integration with pygame
* v3 - class first design approach
